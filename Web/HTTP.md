5. DELETE
The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.

6. CONNECT
The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.

7. OPTIONS
The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource.

8. TRACE
The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
