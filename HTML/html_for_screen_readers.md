<strong>Lorem ipsum<strong>
```
* The `<strong>` element makes text ***bold***.
* It also semantically marks text as important; this affects tools, like screen readers, that users with visual impairments will rely on to use your website.
* The tone of voice on some screen readers will change to communicate the importance of the text within a strong element.
* ***The `<strong>` tag is used when we want to indicate the importance, seriousness, or urgency of a word or section of content without changing the meaning of the content itself.***

* The `<em>` element makes text ***italic***.
* It also semantically places emphasis on the text, which again may affect things like screen readers.
* ***Whenever we want to emphasize something in our markup with verbal stress, we should use `<em>` tags***.
