* Earlier everyone used to buy servers to deploy their applications.

* ***Data center*** > place were all the servers are stored and setup(wiring, battery backup, temp control).
* Drawback
  
  1. costly.

  2. Wastage of resource (like a server has configuration 100 GB RAM and you using only 20 GB i.e. only deploy one application).
* Solution (***VIRTUALIZATION***)
  * Solves wastage of resource.
    * Instead of deploying one application on server, with virtualization ***you can create virtual server on actual server***. 
    * And on each virtual server you can deploy one application. (like a server of 100 GB and you using virtual servers on it you can deploy five 20 GB applications, [this reduces wastage of resources]).

# CLOUD
* We can request various virtual machines or servers to clooud providers for deploying our applications and cloud provider share their IP address.

* User(we) does'nt know where the server is located hence called as cloud.
* Cloud is managed by system administrator.

## Private cloud
* Your own private cloud(maintained & managed by your organization).
* Only access to your organizartion(i.e. only your organization can deploy application on that cloud).

## Public cloud
* Anyone you has account in that cloud provider irrespective of organization  can request virtual machine(server).
* Maintained & managed by cloud provider.
* Benefits
  * No need of maintainance of hardware.
  * No need of configuration of servers.
  * Cost effective
### We can create virtual private cloud inside public cloud.

## Famous cloud providers
* AWS
* MS Azure
* Google cloud platform (GCP)
* Oracle cloud
* Digital ocean.
