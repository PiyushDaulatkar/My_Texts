# Paas (Platform as a Service)
* Platform as a Service is a specific kind of hosting provider.

## How do PaaS services work?S\
### Instances
* virtual “computers” called instances which run your app.
* Basically, one instance means a single instance of your application running at one time.

*  Multiple instances are like having several copies of your app running simultaneously, which allows you to handle more traffic.
*  

### Databases
* The second most important thing PaaS providers give you is databases.
  
### Domain names
* PaaS providers will give you a random domain name when you first deploy.
